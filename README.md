a pretty straightforward menu-based banking program. 
use numbers 1-5 (and beyond if you make that many accounts) to navigate the menus.
Most errors should be caught and dealt with.

Tried to ensure my comments were extensive and as helpful as neccesary.

one main file and then a single .h and .cpp for the Bank Account class.
